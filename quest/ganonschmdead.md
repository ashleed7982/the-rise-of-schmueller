## Master Mueller is proud!
You can't believe it...
You've done it! You slain the clone and ganon! Restoring peace in humanity. Within minutes, buildings rebuilt, people got back up and brushed off any dust and dirt left over, confused, but happy to be alive.

_You thought to yourself, "I'm **way** cooler than Tony Stark..."_

It was like the clock had reset itself, and you were the Earth's savior!

Mueller gives you his final words, ready to give up his soul for the new to be `Code Master`. "Schmuller..." Says in a softt tone. "He came to slay my pupils and I... And we did not him do it! He was a pompous bigot... now he has faced his death by our hands... I can't believe I _**cha cha slid**_ my foot up his ass! He really came to `git` some of these hands, what a fool! For now take this... because **I have to go take care of my 2 daughters, wife and soon to be coming baby...** it will help you break through the clouds of the next centuries of hardships and `arrows to the knees` and many `merge conflicts` and `syntax errors`... my soul the heart of SEP i give it to you to safe keep"

Mueller detaches his soul, in a powerful bright blast of light in all directions, and golden dust going with it, Mueller is gone.

You're teary eyed, but understanding of his sacrifices, and you feel much stronger than before, and you go forward to use your power for good!

But for now... You decide to go home, talk to friends and binge watch some of your favorite anime.

While watching Jotaro's Bizarre Adventure, thinking about stands, you drift off sto sleep...
