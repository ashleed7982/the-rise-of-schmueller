# You don't seem to care what happens and brush it off, as if you have seen this every Tuesday and just decide to go home with burned and cut clothes.
## You discover that your friends are all dead and your family is dead too.

### But oh well, you're tired and burned up so choose to shower, but your sad lonely partment is wrecked from the earthquake caused by the blast-explosion.

You give up and lay down in what used to be your bed, but now looks like a few planks and wonder _"Should I live in the chum bucket with Mark ZUCCerberg?"_

You fall asleep with ease, tired from all the motion of today.
