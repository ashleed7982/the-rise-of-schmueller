## You chose to **betray** Schmueller!
_Schmuller stares down Mueller_...

Mueller calls to you, his  `github and git` powers fading, "_**You**_ were the chosen one! you were supposed to destroy the sith not join them!"

Schmueller scoffs, "_**Do not**_ listen to him! He will only use your power to push himself ahead!"

You think, "It's time for the reverse card..."

You use your ultimate gamer power to punch him straight through Schmueller's chest...

He turns his head to you and shouts, "YOU FOOL!"

He slowly collapses and as he fades off to death

You say, in a soft tone, "You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smoooooooth criminal!"

You've won! You Betrayed Schmueller and saved the world!
All that's left to do is...well...sleep! You're tired!
You go home to greet family and sleep at your apt later that night...
