You feel the tri-force of courage appear on the palm of your hand! You hold your hand out to the distance pulling something towards you. Like thor's hammer, `The Master Sword` appears in your hand and it glows in the presence of Ganon as you go and deliver a large flurry of slashes at Ganon's head. The sword tears the beast to shreds.... once Ganon lay defeated, Schmueller has had enough and walks over and grabs hold of the sword. He snaps the blade in half like a hard noodle... he picks you up by your throat and crushes it like a soda can! He wastes no time by killing all in the shrine and spreading his evil across the world!

It's... cold... and dark.

You hear a weird noise...

_...ring..._
