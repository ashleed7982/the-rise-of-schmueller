# Master has used `code` on you!
Master Mueller has awakened your powers! You feel a powerful surge run through your body. You look to your hands and see the code running through your veins, and feel the power of  `git` and `github` growing!

Mueller smiles and says, "My pupil, this power within you is pure. Uncontrolled, it will spill out of you like fire and be useless and destructive, I will teach you how to control it, just as Matt from Wii Sports told me, focus on where you want it to come out of what you want it to do. Then and only then you will be able to destroy schmueller. Do you `git` it?"

### _Do you want to train?_
