# A strange man appears infront of you, he takes a large katana made of `code`, you can see written all over it is... oh no!
## It can't be, the most POWERFUL line of text for `git`...

### It's `git rm -rf` ...

The looks familiar... you get a closer look, it's Schmueller! Time feels like it's going so slow, yet you're unable to react fast enough for whats next!

#### Schmueller says, "All that you touch, And all that you see, All that you taste, All you feel, And all that you love, And all that you hate, All you distrust, All you save, And all that you give, And all that you deal, And all that you buy,Beg, borrow or steal, And all you create, And all you destroy, And all that you do, And all that you say, And all that you eat, And everyone you meet (everyone you meet), And all that you slight, And everyone you fight, And all that is now, And all that is gone, And all that's to come, And everything under the sun is in line, But the sun is eclipsed by the moon and it's Schmueller's time to shine!"

Schmueller stabs the katana straight through your heart!
Everything instantly goes black...
You hear a noise...
